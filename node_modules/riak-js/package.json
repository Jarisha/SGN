Not providing a callback **will** output to `console.log` regardless of the setting\n\n#### 0.4.0rc3\n\n - Allow headers to override, useful for reverse proxies sitting between node and Riak\n - URI-encoding bucket/key is now an option (encodeUri)\n - Add documentation for map/reduce arguments\n - Remove agent from meta, which should fix critical bug (#64, #67)\n - Allow logging to alternate streams. And default to stderr, not stdout (thanks Mark!)\n - Add docs for host/port (thanks Ken!)\n - Add the new `presort` property for Riak Search (thanks Greg!)\n\n#### 0.4.0rc2\n\n - Major docs update => [http://riakjs.org](http://riakjs.org)\n - `keys=stream` emits `keys` events\n - `walk` now accepts `noJSON`\n - Support Map/Reduce timeout option\n - Protobuf interface refactor (still experimental support in 0.4)\n - Minor bug fixes\n\n#### 0.4.0rc1\n\n - node 0.4.x compatibility\n - npm 1.0 compatibility\n - Minor bug fixes\n\n#### 0.3.6\n\n - Fix index.js and package.json for npm compat\n - Fix recursing usermeta\n - Fix for luwak location parsing\n - Updates related to Riak Search operations\n\n#### 0.3.0beta6\n\n - Test backend implementation\n - Connect session store\n - Protobuf parsing is now more robust\n - Replace client every time ECONNREFUSED occurs\n - Initial Riak Search support\n - Minor bugfixing and internals refactoring\n\n#### 0.3.0beta5\n\n - Add support for bucket listing in HTTP (new Riak 0.14 feature)\n - Updated to CoffeeScript 1.0.0\n - Fixed a memory leak caused by adding too many Event Listeners\n - If there's no `vclock` present in a Meta, do not send any `clientId`\n\n\n### License\n\nSimplified BSD License\n\nCopyright 2011 Francisco Treacy.
