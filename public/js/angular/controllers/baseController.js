/* Controllers
 * Angular controllers contain 2 way data-binded variables that are shared in the view.
 * The Angular router will detect url changes and route us to the correct controller + template.
 * The template will be used to fill ng-view, which represents all the html inside the <body></body>
 * Resolve functions are executed before routing to a specific controller.
