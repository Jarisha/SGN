  <b>11. ARBITRATION</b><br/><br/>
  <p>For any dispute you have with the Company, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the
  dispute with us informally. If the Company has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally,
  we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
  relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American
  Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
  Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and the Company agree otherwise,
  the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA
  filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that the Company will pay for your
  reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is
  non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered
  by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert
  and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
  jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from
  the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service.  All claims
  ]must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or
  representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims.
  You agree that, by entering into these terms, you and the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate
  in a class action.</p>

  States District Court for the Northern District of California, for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).
